About Bay Day

Bay Day is a Ruby-on-Rails project that utilizes the bandsintown API along with user-defined shows to expose a verbose, live music and events database specific to the San Francisco Bay Area. Users are able to attend shows and see which shows other users are attending from present day to 3 days in the future.

This project was built to demonstrate comprehension of Ruby, Ruby-On-Rails, PostgreSQL (creating many-to-many associations), RSpec, JavaScript and jQuery mobile for responsiveness.

Built in a week by Mark Marsella, Samuel Hastings and DonteÂ´ Burney.
